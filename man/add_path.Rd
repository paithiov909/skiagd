\usage{
add_path(
  img,
  path,
  rsx_trans = matrix(c(1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), length(path), 6, byrow = TRUE),
  ...,
  props = paint()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{img}{A raw vector of picture.}

\item{path}{Characters of SVG notations like \code{"M10 10 H 90 V 90 H 10 L 10 10"}.}

\item{rsx_trans}{A double matrix with 6 columns where each row represents an RSX transform.
Each column of the matrix corresponds to the scale, the angle of rotation (in radians),
the amount of translation in the X-axis direction and in the Y-axis direction,
and the X and Y coordinates of the transformation origin.}

\item{...}{For some drawing functions, you can specify \code{width} and \code{color} as named arguments.
\itemize{
\item \code{width} must be a numeric vector of stroke widths for each shape.
\item \code{color} must be an integer matrix where each \emph{\strong{column}} is an RGBA color for each shape.
}

If they are not provided as named arguments, they will be taken from \code{props}.
If the function does not matter them,  \code{...} is simply ignored.}

\item{props}{A list of painting attributes out of \code{\link[=paint]{paint()}}.}
}
\value{
A raw vector of picture.
