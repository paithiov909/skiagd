Embeds an image file as a base64-encoded HTML \verb{<img>} tag.

The image file is read from disk, encoded as a data URI, and wrapped in a
browsable HTML object.
}

This function is designed as a lightweight helper for visualization and
documentation purposes. It does not perform any image decoding itself and
relies on the file being readable by \code{base64enc::dataURI()}.
